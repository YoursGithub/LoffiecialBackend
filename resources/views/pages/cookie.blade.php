        <h2>L'Officiel Peru Cookie Policy</h2><br>
        <p>This document informs Users about the technologies that enable this Website to achieve the purposes described below. These technologies enable the Owner to access and store information (e.g., by using a Cookie) or use resources (e.g., by running a script) on a User's device when the User interacts with this Website.</p><br>
        <p>For simplicity, all of these technologies are referred to as "Trackers" in this document unless there is a reason to differentiate between them. For example, although Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile applications because they are browser-based Trackers. Therefore, in this document, the term Cookies is only used when it is specifically intended to indicate this specific type of Tracker.</p><br>
        <p>Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may require the User's consent. Where consent is given, it may be freely withdrawn at any time by following the instructions provided in this document.</p>
        <p>This Website uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called "first-party" Trackers). As of now, no data is shared with any third party.</p><br>
        <p>The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifespan set by the Owner. Some expire at the end of the User's browsing session.</p>
